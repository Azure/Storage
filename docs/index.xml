      <description>Application and Workload Update #  Overview #  The purpose of this document is to provide steps and ways to migrate the workloads and applications from Gen1 to Gen2 after data migration is completed.
This can be applicable for below migration patterns:
  Incremental Copy pattern
  Lift and Shift copy pattern
  Dual Pipeline pattern
  As part of this, we will configure services in workloads used and update the applications to point to Gen2 mount.</description>

      <description>Azure Blob Storage - Setup Object Replication with ARM Templates #  Object replication asynchronously copies block blobs between a source storage account and a destination account.
You can find a good overview of the service here, and instructions on how to deploy it via the portal here.
Here we are going to focus on deploying Object Replication with ARM. You will see we are doing this in 3 steps with three templates orchestrated with some CLI code.</description>

      <description>Azure blob storage data management and retention #  When you store your data in blob storage, there are a number of policies which govern how your data is managed and retained in the event of deletion. Data management is strictly governed and Microsoft® is committed to ensuring that your data remains your data, without exception. When you delete your data - either through an API or due to a subscription being removed - there are varying policies which dictate the length of time for which your data may be retained in the event you would need to recover it.</description>

      <description>Azure Blob Storage Upload API&amp;rsquo;s #  Customers typically use existing applications such as AzCopy, Azure Storage Explorer, etc. or the Azure Storage SDK&amp;rsquo;s (.NET, Java, Node.js, Python, Go, PHP, Ruby) when building custom apps to access the Azure Storage API&amp;rsquo;s. However, a good understanding of the API&amp;rsquo;s is critical when tuning your uploads for high performance. This document provides an overview of the different upload API&amp;rsquo;s to help you compare the differences between them.</description>

      <description>Azure Storage Supported Character Scrubber #  Azure Storage supports a wide variety of Unicode characters across containers, blobs, metadata, and snapshots. When you are migrating from another storage system to Azure, you may find that some characters supported in your source system (e.g., AWS S3) are not supported by Azure and will require an object to be renamed.
The PowerShell script AzureStorageSupportedCharacterScrubber.ps1 provides a turnkey solution to discovering unsupported characters in your file names with a simple CSV input.</description>
